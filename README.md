#Project Title
CyberSecTNT

##What is CyberSecTNT 
CyberSecTNT is a game with the aim of helping non-technical users
get a general idea of how the security in a digital environment can
be easily breached. Since the application is aimed at non-technical
users it will not be complicated and will give the users a general
idea of how breaches happen from both sides, attacking and defending.
With how the internet is getting more integrated with our lives by
the day it is crucial for people to get educated on how to keep their
data safe and that is the aim of our application.
